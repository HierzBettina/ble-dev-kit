*Note*: I have ceased working on projects with the HM-10 and the CC2541. The difficulties of dealing with the IAR toolchain are too great. I now recommend [ARM mbed solutions](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51822/) if you intend to pursue developing a BLE peripheral.

BLE Dev Kit
====

Getting into low power Bluetooth peripheral prototyping can get expensive quickly. This project aims to chart out and the document the cheapest, easiest way to create a true, custom peripheral with its own profile. Head on over the [wiki](https://github.com/nickswalker/ble-dev-kit/wiki) to read more.

A sub ten dollar CC2541 development board based on the HM-10 module. This board is a fork of Ladvien's excellent work with the module.
